    \textbf{The Problem:} Spending too much time at early stations leaves no time for later ones.
    
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    \textbf{Our Solution: Station Budget Constraint}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each station gets a \textbf{time budget} based on its potential benefit
        \item Stations with more broken bikes get more time
        \item Unused time \textbf{redistributed} to later stations
    \end{itemize}
